Nordic countries are hosting several large scale scientific experimental facilities, including Photon and Neutron (PaN) reserach infrastructures, in particular MAX IV synchrotron laboratory and European Spallation Source (ESS), both situated in Lund. With the excellent particle accelerator source brightness and fast detectors enormous volumes of scientific data are produced. Almost a thousand of scientists annually are using these research infrastructures to conduct scientific experiments in relation to biology, chemistry, physics, material science and also geology or cultural heritage. In late 2018 several European PaN research infrastructures, including ESS, started a project called PaNOSC [1] and they were complemented a year later with the ExPaNDS [2] project at national PaN facilities, including MAX IV, within the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) initiative. Both projects aim for expanding practices of scientific data management and analysis towards Open Science and FAIR data principles. Strategy, several scientific application cases, which should prototype the EOSC services for PaN users communities, and tools chosen can be briefly introduced giving an essence what can be the future scientific data service for the relevant communities.
