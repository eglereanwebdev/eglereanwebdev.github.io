We would like to have a discussion on computational reproducibility and the
FAIR principles in relation to RSE. In particular we would hope flesh out some
stories on challenges/solutions related to computational reproducibility – e.g
experiences from trying to rerun an analysis on a new system or
training/supporting others in reproducible practices. Ultimately being able to
drafts some tips/tricks or a checklist of things to consider to address common
pain-points.

Some work on surveying the field is being done in the the Research Data
Alliance (RDA), FORCE 11 and ReSA etc. but it would probably be an
interesting discussion to have with a Nordic RSE perspective.

A result of this discussion could be published as a blog post.
