GROMACS is a free, open-source molecular dynamics community code mainly
designed for simulations of proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. It is one of
the fastest and most popular scientific software packages available, and can
run on central processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs). In
this session, Mark Abraham (former development manager of GROMACS) will
illustrate software development practices that helped build the GROMACS
developer community. Mark will be happy to take any questions you might have,
e.g. on how to apply similar ideas to the software projects you are working on.
