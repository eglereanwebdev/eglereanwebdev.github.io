Procuring an HPC system - a.k.a. a supercomputer - is a complex and
multifaceted task. Before sending out the *Request For Proposals* the procurer
needs to quantify requirements along several dimensions and decide on an
acceptable level of risk. Should the tendered system maximize benefit for
existing users and use cases, or should possible future user communities and
emerging HPC workloads be factored in? Do you prioritize throughput capability
or minimizing time to solution for given workloads? How important are
acquisition and running costs compared to other measures? Are you willing to
invest in future technologies which would require significant refactoring of
commonly used HPC simulation software? Which HPC software should be included in
the benchmarking suite, and how should benchmark results be scored? This
contribution will present a walk through of several aspects of an HPC
procurement, from the perspective of an HPC application expert responsible for
benchmarking but not involved in high-level decision making. If thereâ€™s
interest, the presentation can be followed by a discussion session where
experiences can be shared and a set of general guidelines summarized.
