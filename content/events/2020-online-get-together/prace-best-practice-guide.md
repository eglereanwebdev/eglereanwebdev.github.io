The just released PRACE - Best Practice Guide for Modern processors (ARM
Kunpeng & THX2, Intel Skylake and AMD Rome) is just released.  A short
introduction to the guide will be given. Topics cover architecture, programming
environment, tuning, performance libraries, performance and introduction to
European systems using these processors. A couple of hands on examples and
tricks to some of the tools in an optimal way will also be presented.
