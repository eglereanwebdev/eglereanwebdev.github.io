Research Software Engineering: it's obviously about software, right?
It could be, but I believe we can adopt a broader viewpoint.  We have
all heard countless times about the systematic factors affecting
inequality in science, but how much does access to computing, or
computing training, contribute to this?  In this talk, I will first
outline some factors contributing to inequality of computing which I
have noticed after years of supporting researchers.  I will relate
this to the services which can be provided by RSEs, and present a
vision for addressing this by developing our own skills and promoting
RSE services to our institutions.
